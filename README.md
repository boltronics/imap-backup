# Installation

```shell
$ gem install 'imap-backup'
```

# Setup

In order to do backups, you need to add accounts and specify the folders to backup.

Run:

```shell
$ imap-backup setup
```

The setup system is a menu-driven command line application.

It creates ~/.imap-backup directory and configuration file. E.g.:

```json
{
  "accounts":
  [
    {
      "username": "my.user@gmail.com",
      "password": "secret",
      "local_path": "/path/to/backup/root",
      "folders":
        [
          {"name": "[Gmail]/All Mail"},
          {"name": "my_folder"}
        ]
    }
  ]
}
```

It connects to GMail by default, but you can also specify a server:

```json
{
  "accounts":
  [
    {
      "username": "my.user@gmail.com",
      "password": "secret",
      "server": "my.imap.example.com",
      "local_path": "/path/to/backup/root",
      "folders":
        [
          {"name": "[Gmail]/All Mail"},
          {"name": "my_folder"}
        ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Google Apps

* Enable IMAP access to your account via the GMail interface (Settings/Forwarding and POP/IMAP),
* In imap-backup setup, set the server to imap.gmail.com

# Security

Note that email usernames and passwords are held in plain text
in the configuration file.

The directory ~/.imap-backup, the configuration file and all backup
directories have their access permissions set to only allow access
by your user.

# Run Backup

Manually, from the command line:

```shell
$ imap-backup
```

Alternatively, add it to your crontab.

## Result

Each folder is saved to an mbox file.
Alongside each mbox is a file with extension '.imap', which lists the source IMAP
UIDs to allow a full restore.

# Troubleshooting

If you have problems:

1. ensure that you have the latest release,
2. turn on debugging output:

```json
{
  "accounts":
  [
    ...
  ],
  "debug": true
}
```

# Restore

All missing messages are pushed to the IMAP server.
Existing messages are left unchanged.

This functionality requires that the IMAP server supports the UIDPLUS
extension to IMAP4.

# Other Usage

List IMAP folders:

```shell
$ imap-backup folders
```

Get statistics of emails to download per folder:

```shell
$ imap-backup status
```

# Design Goals

* Secure - use a local file protected by permissions
* Restartable - calculate start point based on already downloaded messages
* Standalone - do not rely on an email client or MTA
